## **🎬 Movie Correlation Project**
This project explores a dataset of movies to uncover insights and correlations between various features, such as budget, gross revenue, runtime, and more. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, inspired by Alex the Analyst’s approach to data projects.

**📊 Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze how different attributes of movies are related to each other. Specifically, we look into:

How budget correlates with gross earnings

Which numerical and categorical variables are most closely associated

Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis

Visualizing relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib

**📁 Dataset**

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle:
Movies Dataset by Daniel Grijalva

It contains information on over 7000 movies, including:

Title

**📈 Key Findings**

There is a positive correlation between a movie’s budget and its gross revenue.

Some production companies tend to have consistently higher grossing movies.

Numeric and object data types can both be analyzed for correlation when encoded properly.
